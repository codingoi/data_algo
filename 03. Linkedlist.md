## Linked List Introduction
Linked lists are one of the basic data structures used in computer science. They have many direct applications and serve as the foundation for more complex data structures.

The list is comprised of a series of nodes as shown in the diagram. The head node is the node at the beginning of the list. Each node contains data and a link (or pointer) to the next node in the list. The list is terminated when a node’s link is null. This is called the tail node.

Consider a one-way train travel. The trip could involve traveling through several station (nodes) connected by routee segments (links). In this example, the initial departure station is the head node and the final arrival station is the tail node.

Since the nodes use links to denote the next node in the sequence, the nodes are not required to be sequentially located in memory. These links also allow for quick insertion and removal of nodes as you will see in future exercises.

Common operations on a linked list may include:

- adding nodes
- removing nodes
-finding a node
- traversing (or traveling through) the linked list
- 
Linked lists typically contain unidirectional links (next node), but some implementations make use of bidirectional links (next and previous nodes).

## Linked List Example
As an example, we added values to the linked list diagram from the introduction.

This linked list contains three nodes (node_a, node_b, and node_c).

Each node in this particular list contains a string as its data. As the sequence is defined, the order is "cats", "dogs", and "birds".

The list ends at node_c, since the link within that node is set to null.

## Linked Lists Adding and Removing Nodes
With linked lists, because nodes are linked to from only one other node, you can’t just go adding and removing nodes willy-nilly without doing a bit of maintenance.

### Adding a new node
Adding a new node to the beginning of the list requires you to link your new node to the current head node. This way, you maintain your connection with the following nodes in the list.

### Removing a node
If you accidentally remove the single link to a node, that node’s data and any following nodes could be lost to your application, leaving you with orphaned nodes.

To properly maintain the list when removing a node from the middle of a linked list, you need to be sure to adjust the link on the previous node so that it points to the following node.

Depending on the language, nodes which are not referenced are removed automatically. “Removing” a node is equivalent to removing all references to the node.

## Linkedlist Javascript

class Node {
  constructor(data, next=null) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = next;
  }
  
  setNextNode {
    
  }
}

class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
  }

  addToHead(data) {
    const newHead = new Node(data);
    const currentHead = this.head;
    this.head = newHead;
    if(currentHead) {
      this.head.setNextNode(currentHead);
    }
  }
}
